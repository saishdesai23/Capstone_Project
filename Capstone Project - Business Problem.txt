A guide to explore to new place for stay 

When a person shifts to an unknown place for living,
he/she has to search for multiple things needed for 
a stay in that place. For a daily routine the person 
needs to be aware for all the spots in his/her locality.
Some precise and consildated data has to be collected
to recommend some important spots in the locality to the 
person for him to get settled in the new locality. This data can 
be in terms of stay, food, entertainment spots etc. So this project 
involves developement of a recommendation system for important 
spots in a locality working as a guide for a person newly settled in the
locality
